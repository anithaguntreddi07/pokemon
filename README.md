## Detailed Explanation

### Backend (`server/index.js`)

The backend server is an Express application that provides APIs to manage Pokémon and Pokémon owners. It includes endpoints for listing, adding, editing, and deleting Pokémon, as well as listing Pokémon owners.

- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/pokemon`: Lists all Pokémon.
  - `POST /api/add-pokemon`: Adds a new Pokémon.
  - `GET /api/pokemon-owners`: Lists all Pokémon owners.
  - `PUT /api/edit-pokemon/:id`: Edits a Pokémon by ID.
  - `DELETE /api/delete-pokemon/:id`: Deletes a Pokémon by ID.

The server uses `cors` to handle cross-origin requests and `express.json` to parse JSON request bodies.

### Frontend (`client/src/App.js` and Components)

The frontend is a React application that interacts with the backend server to manage and display Pokémon and Pokémon owners. It uses React Router for navigation and includes several components:

- **HomePage:** Displays a dropdown to select Pokémon owners, a table of their Pokémon, and controls to interact with the Pokémon.
- **AddPokemon:** A form to add new Pokémon.
- **EditPokemon:** A form to edit existing Pokémon.
- **ListPokemons:** Displays a list of all Pokémon.
- **AddPokemonPage:** Another form to add new Pokémon with additional details.

The application uses state management to handle the list of Pokémon and their owners, and it updates the UI dynamically based on user interactions.

### CSS Styling

The application uses basic CSS for styling, ensuring the UI is responsive and user-friendly. The styles are defined in the `client/src/App.css` file, which includes base styles, responsive styles, and specific styles for different components.

### Example Usage

1. **Add a Pokémon:**
   - Navigate to the "Add Pokemon" page.
   - Fill in the details and submit the form.
   - The Pokémon will be added to the list and associated with the specified owner.

2. **View Pokémon Owners:**
   - Navigate to the "List Pokemons" page.
   - The page displays all Pokémon along with their abilities and owners.

3. **Interact with Pokémon:**
   - On the HomePage, select a Pokémon owner from the dropdown.
   - The owner's Pokémon will be listed.
   - Use the buttons to make the Pokémon move, flee, or cease.
   
### Features
